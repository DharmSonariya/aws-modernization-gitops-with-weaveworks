# Install App Mesh

In this section we will be deploying components to our EKS cluster that will enable integration with [AWS App Mesh](https://aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/).

AWS App Mesh is a service mesh that provides application-level networking. It allows services to communicate across different types of compute infrastructure (e.g. EKS, EC2). It also provides end-to-end visibility of how your services communicate with each other.

For more information see the [AWS App Mesh Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html).
