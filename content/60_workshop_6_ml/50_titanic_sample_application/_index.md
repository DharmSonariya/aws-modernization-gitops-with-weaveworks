## Titanic Survival Prediction

In this section, we will build and deploy a sample application [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/paulcarlton-ww/mlops-titanic)

The `titanic-survival-prediction.py` sample runs a Spark ML pipeline to train a classfication model using random forest on AWS Elastic Map Reduce(EMR).
