# Welcome to GitOps on AWS: Managing governance, risk and compliance for Kubernetes on EKS

4 out of 10 enterprises are now running Kubernetes in a production environment today but many still consider security and policy concerns an overwhelming obstacle and bottleneck to innovation. 

GitOps operation practices give teams a head start as they rely on git’s strong correctness and security. Every pull request has a built-in and fully auditable trail. Many companies need to look beyond just compliance and seek a full GRC solution that’s integral to their workflows.

Using a combination of instructor led demonstrations and hands-on exercises, the workshop will enable the attendee to go into detail on the following topics:

* How to deploy opa gatekeeper and manage policies/compliance in your eks cluster
* How to create policies and test they work in your cluster
* How to manage authorisation in to your eks cluster using iam roles
* How to create iam roles for service accounts in your cluster

## An operating model for cloud native 

* An operating model for Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, providing a set of best practices that unify deployment, management and monitoring for containerized clusters and applications.
* A path towards a developer experience for managing applications; where end-to-end CICD pipelines and git workflows are applied to both operations, and development.
